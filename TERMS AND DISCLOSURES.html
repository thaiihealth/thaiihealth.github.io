<br>Studio Opening Disclosures
<br>QTD metrics as of 12/31/2021
<br>“Initial Studio Openings” means the number of studios that were determined to be first opened during such period. Prior to October 1, 2021, we classify an Initial Studio Opening to occur in the first month in which the studio first generates monthly revenue of at least $4,500. After October 1, 2021, we classify an Initial Studio Opening to occur in the month in which we record the initial studio opening in our internal systems. Any studios that did not have an Initial Studio Opening under the prior definition are included as of October 1, 2021. Initial Studio Openings are not adjusted downward for studios that were temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise.
<br>“Total Studios” as of any specified date, means the total cumulative Initial Studio Openings as of that date less cumulative permanent studio closures as of that date. Total Studios are not adjusted downward for studios that were temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise.</p>
